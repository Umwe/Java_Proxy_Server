# Java_Proxy_Server
This is the proxy server configurations for managing the client requests before they can reach the Springboot

## Add GeoIP2 Dependency
Add the GeoIP2 library to your pom.xml:

xml
Copy code
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.maxmind.geoip2</groupId>
    <artifactId>geoip2</artifactId>
    <version>2.15.0</version>
</dependency>


## Configure GeoIP2 Database
Download the GeoLite2 City database from MaxMind and place it in your resources directory.

4. Implement the Proxy Logic
Application Properties
Configure the URL of your actual Spring Boot application in application.properties:


proxy.target.url=http://localhost:8080


## Application Properties Update
Make sure to add the geolite2.db.location property to your application.properties:

properties
Copy code
geolite2.db.location=GeoLite2-City.mmdb




## Running the Proxy Server
Run the Spring Boot application. It will act as a proxy server, validating requests based on geographical location before forwarding them to the target URL.

Conclusion
This setup creates a proxy server using Spring Boot that can validate requests based on geographical location using the GeoIP2 library and then forward them to your actual Spring Boot application. This approach allows you to leverage the full power of Spring Boot for request validation and proxying logic.
